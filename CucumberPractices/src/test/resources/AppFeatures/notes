Two types of Regular Expression in cucumber:

1. Regular Expression --> [0-9]+, (\\d+)
2. Cucumber Expression (2017)

Rules:
1. Step def. file will be generating cucumber exp by default
2. But you can use regular exp also in step def file
3. You can mix both regular and cucumber exp in step definition file
4. but you can not mix both expressions in a step definition method

(string} {int} {float} -- cucumber expression
